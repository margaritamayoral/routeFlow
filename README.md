# routeFlow

This repo is aiming to offer different methodologies to infer the interconnections that can exist in a medium that allows the movement of the fluid. Those infered routes are potential routes and interconnections that a fluid can use during the fluid dynamics and are inferred using data as rate flow, pressures, and physical conditions of the medium.
